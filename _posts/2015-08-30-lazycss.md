## The Idea

  * You don't always _have_ to use CSS frameworks.
  * Sometimes all you might wanna do is a simple single-page article page.
  * So, I wanted to make things easier. No frameworks.
  * But I still need a system.
  * And I gotta build them quick.

## "Nomad" Styles.

(Better name, TBA.)

I wanna build a bunch of "nomad" styles first. They're not doing anything yet.
They're not specifically meant for something yet.
And the idea is they shouldn't be meant _just_ for something.

~~~
.base-padding {
  ... set the structure ...
}
~~~

Or `.base-structure` if you definitely know you'll always have to use the same padding values, or if you're using `box-border` (but you can actually set these things in a global scope).

Moving on...

~~~
.pink-bg {
  ... set the mood ...
}

.blur-shadow {
  ... stuff ...
}

.round-corner {
  ... stuff ...
}
~~~

Then I'll build something with it.

~~~
.pink-button {
  @extend .base-padding;
  @extend .pink-bg;
  @extend .blur-shadow;
  @extend .round-corner;
}
~~~

But what if we don't want pink?

Variables.

~~~
$primary-color: color;
$secondary-color: secondary-color;

.primary-bg {
  background-color: $brand-color;
}

.secondary-bg {
  background-color: $secondary-color;
}
~~~

And so forth (if you fancy tertiaries, etc.).

Then build the buttons.

~~~
.button {
  @extend .base-padding;
  @extend .blur-shadow;
  @extend .round-corner;

  .primary-button {
    @extend .primary-bg;
  }

  .secondary-button {
    @extend .secondary-bg;
  }

}
~~~

Roughly...

~~~
  <a class=".button .primary-button" href="#">Button</a>
  <a class=".button .secondary-button" href="#">Button</a>
~~~

I'm using autocomplete but, yes, using `btn` helps.

## Some Possible Advantages.

> "I want a pink bar that has a blurry drop shadow, etc."

Your wish is my command:

`<nav class="base-padding primary-bg blur-shadow">Content</nav>`

> "... but I also want my cards to be pink with blurry shadows..."

Change `<nav>` to `<div>`:

`<div class="base-padding primary-bg blur-shadow">Content</div>`

> "but they're cards..."

Let's call them cards. (I'm not sure why I'm going to use it yet, but it should be OK.)

`<div class="base-padding primary-bg blur-shadow card">Content</div>`

Thing is, I don't know why I'd would need the `.card` class early in the coding stage yet.

But I know that doesn't hurt anything. I'm sure we'll want to use that later suppose we have to.

> "Hard to type?"

Sure.

~~~
.card,
.nav-bar {
  @extend .primary-bg;
  @extend .base-padding;
  @extend .blur-shadow;
  @extend .round-corner;
}
~~~

Guess that's where you might need the component names now.
