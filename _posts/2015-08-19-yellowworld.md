So, I'm trying out this thingamabob called Jekyll because I just thought it's kinda fun. Nothing much really. Just the usual dabbling with stuff.

Pretty stoked about what I'll be able to do with this thing, though.

This is neat.

Additional cool stuff aside from this is I'm also doing this with Vim -- again, just because it's fun.

It's been forever since I wanted to start to try and go about things like this and, hey!

So, this would be the first file, I guess. I'm just practicing and trying to figure my way around Vim. And it's true, you gotta really get a hang of it. Though running it in Linux (Ubuntu), I think, definitely helped because everything feels a bit more natural, I don't really know.

But again, hey. Stay tuned for stuff I'll be putting out here. Lots of randomness and lots of things breaking because I'll be fiddling with this more in the following days (not with not already rolling-in content from time to time).

Cheers!
