Not an anarchist.

Everybody needs authority.

What everybody should hate, however, is not authority or the concept thereof.

We should hate authorities crossing lines and boundaries.

We should hate totalitarianism... dictatorship.

Authorities exist to promote peace and order.

They don't and should not exist to enforce their personal biases.

They don't have any right to deny us our basic human rights just because.

They don't have any right to deny us, the individuals, the excercise of our individuality and suffocate our free will to the point of internal death.

Not that the individual is perfect.

But neither is the individual a puppet... a machine that only does what a commanding agent tells it to do.

_A word for all authorities of all sorts: don't let it get to your head or we'll chase it out of there._

We all have the capacity to think and to reason.

Democracy is messy.

But we shouldn't have it any other way.

Give the society a chance to celebrate the realization and successes of their percepts or the chance to learn from mistakes arising from such.

Let the babes walk on their own, fall on their own, and get up on their own; and savor the rewards of their realizations.

Control is a part of it -- but not _it_!

We ought to _"take the highway"_ if we would be constantly given the option to do so.

At least, in highways, we have the choice whether to go north or south, east or west -- and let everybody realize and decide on both the best and the worst paths to take.

It's easy to dictate.

It's easy to say _"because I said so"._

And it's easy to shoot down dissentors and critics.

Because democracy demands empathy, patience, understanding. The genuine forms thereof not only demand a clean ear canal but also a clear motive, and an unclouded ego.

Democracy is the long road.

Democracy is a slow cook.

Democracy is imperfect -- and that's what makes it perfect.

Nature is, in itself, imperfect -- but not really so, _is it?_

Trust.

We don't follow whom we don't trust.

It's not that we don't trust whatever it is that qualifies an authority.

In fact, we have an ample amount of trust on the whole beings of all authorities.

That if the authorities think it to be true that their subjects are imperfect beings, capable of harm... of error (in other words: human), that they merit sanctions, control, rules, intervention, and the rightful implementation thereof through an agent of authority, the authorities merit the same in return.

For the tendencies of authorities are no different from those of their subjects.

Except the those tendencies are grately amplified when you are in power.
