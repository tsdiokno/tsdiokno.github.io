Alright. More stuff to practice Vim with.

Now that I'm back to coding stuff again and I work with Git, I also bring back my aliases.

Stuff that I'd actually use at work in the past.

Actually, for a good one, I just (vaguely) remember using one.

Enjoy! (I hope.)

`git config --global alias.pushmoteh 'push origin master'`
